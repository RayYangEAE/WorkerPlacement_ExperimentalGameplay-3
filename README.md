# WorkerPlacement_ExperimentalGameplay-3

Goal - Make a game demo inspired by Worker Placement game mechanic.

I researched some of these games and felt that they do not vary much from each other, then I decided to make a worker placement game do not share some common features:
  1. No turn-based;
  2. The meaning of the worker placement is not driven by the need of a combination of different resources.
  
Inspiration - Tapper: Character(s) could shift between lines and my game could be timing like that. 

Gameplay - Place workers on the assembly line and create as many final products as possible. 
  1. Survive 2 minutes without any part of the assembly line out of capacity. If so, game over!
  2. There are A, B, C - three parts of the assembly line. A semi-finished product is processed through A to C. (For example, a semi-product is waiting in part A; once a worker is available and pick it up, n second(s) is spent to process it; after that, it is passed to part B waiting to be processed, then part C, then final product.) 
  3. When semi-finished products waiting in this part reach 50 pieces, this part is out of capacity.
  4. You have 9 workers. Press 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 to select a certain worker, and use left and right arrow keys to move left and right on the assembly line.
  5. Don't use the + - buttons and input field. They are for testing.

What I have learned -
  1. At first, the game I made is to have a bunch of workers wait to be assigned, and the player have to use the +/- button or enter a number into the input field to allocate them. But it looks so boring. Then I add worker characters and controls for them, then it looks much more vivid and turns out more like a game. I think vividness is important for a game.
  2. This demo reveals some criticism of the dehumanization on the assembly line. But it needs some design to push it further, which I am still thinking about.
